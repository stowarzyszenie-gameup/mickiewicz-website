  "ballads": [
    "In 1822, Adam Mickiewicz published <em>Ballads & romances</em> in Vilnius, which was part of the first volume of his <em>Poetry</em>. For Polish Romanticism, <em>Ballads...</em> are a kind of manifesto in which a literary vision of a new era is defined. It is the date of publication of the collection that is often considered the beginning of Romanticism in Polish literature.",
    "In order to fully understand Mickiewicz's ballads, one should remember that this is a literary genre strongly referring to the idyll known from earlier eras, glorifying a peaceful life close to nature. Considering this, it is important that Mickiewicz placed his ballads in historical realities and places, often known to him from his own life, such as the vicinity of Lake Świteź.",
    "It is in this natural and idyllic world that various supernatural events enter through the eyes of Mickiewicz the poet, the description of which can be found in Ballads and romances. Human life and idyllic reality become disturbed by supernatural factors which are unknown and incomprehensible to a common man. Since then, ”feeling and faith speak more strongly than a wise man's glass and eye.”"

  "didacticHelp": [
    "<em>Ballads and romances</em> is a free game, created for didactic purposes in classes devoted to the work of Adam Mickiewicz and the beginnings of Polish Romanticism.",
    "The main assumption is to familiarize young people with the biography of Adam Mickiewicz and the background of the creation of the poetry book Ballads and romances. In our game, we wanted to show the poet's motivations and important people in his youth and places important to him (Vilnius, Kaunas, Tuhanowicze).",
    "The game has been divided into three memories that the teacher/educator can go through together with the students on their smartphone or a computer/laptop. After each sequence there is an autosave function, so memories can be matched to the topic of the lesson.",
    "Ultimately, the duration of the game is adapted to the lesson time in Polish schools (45 minutes) so that during the classes you can play all the memories and later discuss them with the teacher or - if this is the intention of the person conducting the classes - divide the game into three lesson units, where there is one memory for each lesson.",
    "Once the game has started, the order in which the sequence is played is arbitrary."
